# Fix for 500 Errors on Vercel Development and Preview

## Problem
The application was experiencing 500 errors on Vercel in development and preview modes due to missing environment variables and lack of graceful degradation when external services (database, SMTP) are unavailable.

## Solution
Implemented graceful degradation patterns that allow the application to function with reduced functionality when environment variables are missing, rather than throwing 500 errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Validation (`src/lib/env-validation.ts`)
- Added utility functions to validate environment variables
- Implemented logic to determine when graceful degradation should occur
- Added logging for environment status

### 2. Database Resilience
- Updated Prisma client initialization to handle missing `DATABASE_URL`
- Modified content loader to return empty arrays instead of throwing database errors
- Added `safeDbOperation` wrapper for all database operations

### 3. Authentication System
- Updated better-auth configuration to handle missing database connections
- Modified auth middleware to skip authentication checks in degraded mode
- Updated API routes to return appropriate error responses

### 4. SMTP System
- Added checks for SMTP configuration availability
- Modified email sending to gracefully handle missing SMTP configuration
- Maintains functionality when SMTP is properly configured

## Environment Variables

### Required (Production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

### Optional
- `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server hostname
- `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP server port
- `SMTP_USER`: SMTP username
- `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP password
- `SMTP_FROM`: Default sender email address

## Behavior

### With Full Configuration
- All features work normally
- Database queries return real data
- Email functionality is available
- Authentication system is fully functional

### In Degraded Mode (Missing Environment Variables)
- Application loads without 500 errors
- Database queries return empty arrays/null values
- Email functionality is disabled with graceful warnings
- Authentication is bypassed in development/preview environments
- Console warnings indicate degraded mode status

## Environment Detection
The system automatically detects the environment:
- **Production**: Requires all essential environment variables
- **Development/Preview**: Gracefully degrades with missing variables

## Verification
1. Build succeeds: âœ… `npm run build` completes successfully
2. Graceful degradation: Application shows empty content instead of errors when database is unavailable
3. Console logging: Clear warnings when running in degraded mode

## Usage
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your environment variables
3. For development without database: Simply omit `DATABASE_URL` and the app will show empty content
4. For production: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
